# Facial_Emotion_Recognition_using_deep_learning


Driver code has some bugs will be fixed in next version (to be uploaded soon).  

Driver_image is working fine for the static images and Driver_realtime is working fine with sequence(i.e. videos).  

## Version 1.0.x

These versions are the final version in which ensemble learning model is working and all the parameters are finetuned of the Emotion-net.
I have named my ensemble based model as emotion-net.

## Todo:

1. Directions to run the project.
2. Ensemble learning driver code.
